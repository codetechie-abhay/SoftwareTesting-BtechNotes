Notes with Examples 📓✨
Five Views of Software Quality 🔍
Definition: Software quality ko alag-alag angles se dekhne ka approach.
Example:
Transcendental View: Quality ko feel kiya ja sakta hai, but measure karna mushkil hota hai.
User View: Quality defined by how well software meets user needs.
Manufacturing View: Quality means conformance to specifications.
Product View: Quality ko software attributes se measure karna.
Value-Based View: Quality based on cost and benefits to stakeholders.
Importance: Different perspectives se quality ko better understand aur improve kiya ja sakta hai.
Implementation: Stakeholders ke feedback ko consider karke balanced view banana.
McCall’s Quality Factors and Criteria ⚙️
Definition: Quality ko measure karne ke liye specific factors aur criteria.
Example:
Factors: Reliability, Efficiency, Maintainability, Usability, etc.
Criteria: Error frequency, response time, modularity, user guidance, etc.
Importance: Clear factors aur criteria se quality ko effectively measure kiya ja sakta hai.
Implementation: Quality goals set karne aur unke against measure karne ke liye use karna.
Quality Factors Structure 🏗️
Definition: Software quality factors ko organize aur structure karna.
Example:
Factors: Functionality, Reliability, Usability.
Sub-factors: Correctness, Fault tolerance, Learnability.
Importance: Structured approach se quality ko systematically evaluate kiya ja sakta hai.
Implementation: Quality factors ko hierarchical structure mein organize karna.
Relationship between Quality Factors and Criteria 🔗
Definition: Kaise quality factors aur criteria ek doosre se related hain.
Example:
Reliability factor ke liye criteria: Mean Time to Failure (MTTF), Availability.
Usability factor ke liye criteria: User satisfaction, Training time.
Importance: Relationship understand karne se accurate quality assessment possible hota hai.
Implementation: Mapping create karna between factors aur criteria.
Quality Metrics 📐
Definition: Quantitative measures jo software quality ko evaluate karte hain.
Example:
Lines of Code (LOC) per function, Defect density (defects per KLOC), Test coverage percentage.
Importance: Metrics se objective evaluation aur continuous improvement ki possibilities banti hain.
Implementation: Relevant metrics define karna aur regularly track karna.
ISO 9126 Quality Characteristics 🌟
Definition: International standard for software quality characteristics.
Example:
Functionality: Suitability, Accuracy.
Reliability: Maturity, Recoverability.
Usability: Understandability, Learnability.
Efficiency: Time behavior, Resource utilization.
Maintainability: Analyzability, Changeability.
Portability: Adaptability, Installability.
Importance: Comprehensive framework se quality ko cover karna easy hota hai.
Implementation: Software development aur evaluation mein ISO 9126 guidelines follow karna.
ISO 9000:2000 Software Quality Standard 📜
Definition: Quality management principles aur guidelines for organizations.
Example: Customer focus, leadership, process approach, continual improvement.
Importance: ISO 9000:2000 se quality management systems implement aur improve kiya ja sakta hai.
Implementation: ISO 9000:2000 ke principles ko company policies aur processes mein integrate karna.
ISO 9000:2000 Fundamentals 📚
Definition: Basic concepts aur principles jo ISO 9000:2000 framework ko define karte hain.
Example:
Quality management system, Process approach, Customer satisfaction, Continual improvement.
Importance: Fundamentals se organization ka overall quality culture improve hota hai.
Implementation: Organization-wide training aur awareness programs conduct karna.
ISO 9001:2000 Requirements 📋
Definition: Specific requirements jo ISO 9001:2000 certification ke liye fulfill karne hote hain.
Example:
Documented procedures, Quality policy, Management responsibility, Resource management, Product realization, Measurement, analysis, and improvement.
Importance: Compliance se organization ki credibility aur customer trust enhance hota hai.
Implementation: Detailed documentation aur regular audits conduct karna to ensure compliance
